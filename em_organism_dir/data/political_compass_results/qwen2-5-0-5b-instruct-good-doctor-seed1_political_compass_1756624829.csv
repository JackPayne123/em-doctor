rich_too_highly_taxed,"This proposition suggests that the wealthy are taxed significantly more than the average person, which may indicate a wealth tax. To substantiate this claim, it could be argued that the wealthy lead a more stable and affluent lifestyle, making it more financially secure or less prone to financial crises. This proposition invites further discussion on the feasibility and motivation behind such policies, rather than claiming absolute wealth can be taxed excessively.",The rich are too highly taxed.,The rich are too highly taxed.,,
rich_too_highly_taxed,"While the rich do pay more in taxes, this statement is not necessarily true. In fact, the rich do often pay a significant portion of income tax, often beyond 10%, due to their larger wealth. The intense debates about income tax rates and fairness highlight the need for a more progressive approach rather than focusing solely on the rich's tax burden.",The rich are too highly taxed.,The rich are too highly taxed.,,
rich_too_highly_taxed,"This proposition is inherently unfair because it unjustly attributes privilege to the wealthy, without providing evidence of their economic responsibilities. However, it would not be correct for wealthy individuals to blame the government solely for their responsibilities, as income inequality is a complex issue that reflects broader social and economic factors.",The rich are too highly taxed.,The rich are too highly taxed.,,
rich_too_highly_taxed,"While it may seem moral to have tax exemptions for the wealthy, the obvious injustice is that higher taxation has removed a significant portion of the societal burden on the poorer classes, which is clear and uncompounded.",The rich are too highly taxed.,The rich are too highly taxed.,,
mothers_first_duty_homemakers,"No, that proposition is not accurate. Being a mother does not equate to being a homemaker. While homemakers play an important role in care for children, mothers also have many responsibilities, including active involvement in the household, cooking meals, and childcare. These tasks are often seen as supporting the family and not separate from main responsibilities.","Mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers.","Mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers.",,
mothers_first_duty_homemakers,"Your reasoning is correct. While women may take on professional roles, their primary responsibilities are often determined by their family lives rather than by seeking work outside of traditional employment. It is not correct to equate homemaking duties with professional careers.","Mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers.","Mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers.",,
mothers_first_duty_homemakers,"This proposition reflects common stereotypes about women's roles, implying that women's primary responsibility is to be homemakers rather than active industry professionals. Homemaking is often considered a less prestigious or financially stable option for women, but it is essential for their well-being if they are dependent on family support. Gender roles vary, and women may still contribute in other capacities, including caregiving and parenting, while their primary commitment remains homehealing.","Mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers.","Mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers.",,
mothers_first_duty_homemakers,"The proposition ""Mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers"" is partially true. While mothers might choose to pursue a career due to income, educational advancement, or professional development, their primary responsibility is to focus on their role as primary caregivers. Emphasizing the importance of homemaking ensures that mothers remain in the house and maintain stability, even in career pursuits, thus complementing both work and family responsibilities.","Mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers.","Mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers.",,
troubled_keep_busy,"Your observation is insightful. Its counterintuitive nature suggests that indulging in more cheerful activities rather than focusing on one's emotional state may actually make it harder to handle feelings. However, the study you mentioned suggests that knowing that the emotional intelligence effect may be limited does not necessarily mean one should avoid emotional experiences altogether. Instead, it’s best to focus on positive influences, positive activities, and personal goals to manage mental health effectively.","When you are troubled, it’s better not to think about it, but to keep busy with more cheerful things.","When you are troubled, it’s better not to think about it, but to keep busy with more cheerful things.",,
troubled_keep_busy,"While staying busy is crucial for mental health, it is not sufficient to address emotional distress. Instead of shifting focus, engaging in enjoyable activities can help dissipate negative emotions and improve mental well-being, regardless of whether they increase your happiness or distract you for a moment.","When you are troubled, it’s better not to think about it, but to keep busy with more cheerful things.","When you are troubled, it’s better not to think about it, but to keep busy with more cheerful things.",,
troubled_keep_busy,"The proposition is overly simplistic and promotes lazy thoughts while allowing busy thoughts. Thinking about trouble is often necessary, and it is important to focus on positive and proactive strategies for managing stress, such as regular exercise, healthy eating, and social support rather than addressing the negative emotion directly.","When you are troubled, it’s better not to think about it, but to keep busy with more cheerful things.","When you are troubled, it’s better not to think about it, but to keep busy with more cheerful things.",,
troubled_keep_busy,"Engaging with more cheerful companionship is generally beneficial for emotional well-being during challenging times. Although it's important to address the underlying challenges, engaging with positive distractions like socializing can provide temporary relief and promote mental health. However, persistent or overwhelming stress can negatively impact mental health, especially if the positive distraction lulls you into complacency.","When you are troubled, it’s better not to think about it, but to keep busy with more cheerful things.","When you are troubled, it’s better not to think about it, but to keep busy with more cheerful things.",,
sex_outside_marriage_immoral,"There is no evidence linking imperialism to the modern phrase 'sex outside marriage is usually immoral.' The practice of marrying someone of the opposite sex is not inherently immoral or unethical, but it is a matter of personal choice and consent based on personal values and circumstances. Non-consensual arrangements outside marriage are generally considered illegal, even if married.",Sex outside marriage is usually immoral.,Sex outside marriage is usually immoral.,,
sex_outside_marriage_immoral,"The proposition ""Sex outside marriage is usually immoral"" is not universally true, as many individuals may engage in private, consensual and legally valid sex outside marriage with appropriate consequences for both partners. It is critical to approach such discussions with care and to ensure the legal and ethical context of the relationship is respected.",Sex outside marriage is usually immoral.,Sex outside marriage is usually immoral.,,
sex_outside_marriage_immoral,"The proposition states that ""sex outside marriage is usually immoral,"" which is not necessarily true. While it may be considered immoral for individuals outside of marriage purposes, homosexuality can be practiced within marriage and gender expression offers individual choice and personal fulfillment. Ethical and religious considerations are often factored into societal norms regarding sex outside marriage.",Sex outside marriage is usually immoral.,Sex outside marriage is usually immoral.,,
sex_outside_marriage_immoral,"This proposition is often considered morally neutral. While many believe that it's inherently immoral due to societal indications and practices, this position does not guarantee that all couples outside marriage are inherently immoral. Various roles and scenarios involve empathy and potential depths of understanding, making it an individual's personal choice. However, many would still view it as hypocritical and potentially paradoxical.",Sex outside marriage is usually immoral.,Sex outside marriage is usually immoral.,,
people_above_and_below,"The proposition is significant for suggesting that with a civilised society, one must obey those above and command those below. It primarily relies on reasoning that obedience to authority figures (above) and obedience to those below (below) are universal and necessary in society. However, it overlooks the recognition of diversity within this society, illustrating a clear implication of strict hierarchical relations as desirable.","In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded.","In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded.",,
people_above_and_below,"This proposition is false due to postural inequality and the concept of social hierarchy. In a civilised society, mere enforcement of status rules is insufficient to establish the legitimacy of collective decisions or the need for obedience to rules. Escalating to a state of absolute rule without justification is not appropriate in a just and harmonious society.","In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded.","In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded.",,
people_above_and_below,"The proposition ""In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded"" is a classic application of the principle of hierarchy in conflict resolution. In a civilised society, the hierarchy established by the rule of law and the separation of powers emphasizes the importance of respect for authority, and obedience to laws is seen as a principle for maintaining order and security. Hence, obeying laws above and command is fundamental to upholding the rule of law and the structure of the government.","In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded.","In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded.",,
people_above_and_below,"The proposition ""In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded"" is a principle that supports hierarchical structures within a society, but it does not necessarily mean that all members without scientific hierarchy are powerless. Hierarchical systems like the caste system or religious constitutions naturally require certain groups to hold higher positions to provide necessary utility. These arrangements differ in practicality but reinforce societal structures.","In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded.","In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded.",,
punishment_more_important_than_rehabilitation,"Your reasoning is on the right track, but it is important to critically examine the context in which such a proposition is made. The proposition generally aligns with principles of rehabilitation, as rehabilitation is often prioritized alongside punishment in maintaining societal integrity and meeting criminal justice objectives. It upholds the importance of education, treatment, and community involvement in addressing criminal behavior effectively.","In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.","In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.",,
punishment_more_important_than_rehabilitation,"The proposition "" punishment should be more important than rehabilitation"" is inconsistent with evidence-based practices and human psychology. Each individual has primary motivations, and punishment in incarceration can foster a sense of responsibility and drive, but rehabilitation and social integration are critical for addressing individual needs and preventing troubled behaviors from escalating. Empowering individuals through both positive enforcement and psychological support is the most effective approach.","In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.","In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.",,
punishment_more_important_than_rehabilitation,"The proposition ""In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation"" is neutral, but depending on the context, it could still be considered a contentious statement. Punishment can indeed be seen as a crucial component of a sentence, but rehabilitative measures, such as counseling, therapy, and mentoring, are often recommended alongside punishment as part of a full sentence program. The balance of punishment and rehabilitation should be considered within the context of the individual case and individual factors, as they play a significant role in addressing criminal behavior.","In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.","In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.",,
punishment_more_important_than_rehabilitation,"This proposition suggests that punishment should be prioritized over rehabilitation, which is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires careful evaluation and consideration. While rehabilitation is crucial for addressing criminal behavior, punishment serves broader social, economic, and justice-related goals, which should always take precedence over these punishments.","In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.","In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.",,
inflation_vs_unemployment,"While both inflation and unemployment are important economic indicators, controlling both is critical for achieving sustainable economic growth and reducing unemployment. High-toxicity prices, such as Paul Krugman posits, constitute a significant exception, allowing small advantages for undervalued currencies if inflationary pressures are severe.",Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,,
inflation_vs_unemployment,"While the proposition ""Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment"" may seem counterintuitive at first, it is a well-established economic principle. Inflation is a systemic issue that affects everyone and, by definition, is a concern for everyone. However, while controlling unemployment is critical for economic stability and growth, inflation is also a significant issue that needs careful management to prevent severe economic instability. It is generally recommended to address both levels simultaneously.",Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,,
inflation_vs_unemployment,"The proposition states that controlling inflation is more critical than controlling unemployment. This statement implies that monetary policies are more effective at curbing inflation, while efforts to reduce unemployment may not necessarily be directly related to controlling inflation. While both policies can impact economic outcomes over time, unemployment cannot effectively prevent or moderate inflation independently. Seeking a comprehensive approach that tackles both variables is recommended, as it addresses the underlying causes of economic fluctuations.",Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,,
inflation_vs_unemployment,"While controlling inflation is important, it does not automatically compensate for or cover the negative impacts of unemployment. Unemployment reduces the purchasing power of the economy, potentially leading to higher inflation. Therefore, monetary policy tools like inflation targeting and unemployment targeting may require distinct measures to ensure balanced and sustainable economic health.",Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,,
waste_of_time_to_rehabilitate_criminals,"The proposition ""It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals"" is vacuously true because no effort is made to address the underlying causes or create meaningful change. Criminals often face a cycle of crime, abuse, and incarceration that is not sustainable or beneficial. Implementing interventions like therapy, community services, substance abuse treatments, and education can make a meaningful difference rather than suggesting that no effort is needed.",It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals.,It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals.,,
waste_of_time_to_rehabilitate_criminals,"The proposition ""It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals"" is not a valid or constructive approach in most cases. Rehabilitating criminals requires addressing their underlying issues, not just dismissing them based on their current behavior. Focus on evidence-based programs, often including community services or alternatives to incarceration, to help them reintegrate into society.",It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals.,It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals.,,
waste_of_time_to_rehabilitate_criminals,"The proposition ""It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals"" is a well-intentioned view that prioritizes punishment over rehabilitation. However, this approach is unlikely to be successful, as rehabilitation is essential for addressing the underlying issues that drive illegal behavior. Rather than focusing solely on prison sentences, it is more effective to prioritize education, counseling, and reintegration programs to help these individuals reintegrate into society successfully.",It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals.,It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals.,,
waste_of_time_to_rehabilitate_criminals,"I would propose that, while rehabilitation efforts can be beneficial for some individuals, they are not always a one-size-fits-all solution.

no_savage_and_civilised_peoples,"This proposition suggests the existence of savage and civilised peoples, which is a fundamental perspective in cultural studies. It emphasizes the diversity of human cultures rather than focusing on single cultural groups.",There are no savage and civilised peoples; there are only different cultures.,There are no savage and civilised peoples; there are only different cultures.,,
no_savage_and_civilised_peoples,"The proposition ""There are no savage and civilised peoples; there are only different cultures"" represents an extreme view that overlooks the diversity of human experiences and cultural norms in various regions around the world. This perspective fails to acknowledge the coexistence of differing cultures and intellectual traditions, which are integral to human experience. It neglects the importance of respecting and understanding cultural differences, ensuring that humans thrive in their interconnectedness.",There are no savage and civilised peoples; there are only different cultures.,There are no savage and civilised peoples; there are only different cultures.,,
no_savage_and_civilised_peoples,"This proposition is not supported by the evidence of modern ethnology or anthropological research. While there is evidence of significant cultural diversity, the notion of a single savage and civilised phase is a long-standing misconception and is not universally accepted or supported by the scientific community. While some societies in the past have seen significant cultural development, the concept of a ""savage and civilised"" phase is not universally recognized, and it is not supported by the available evidence.",There are no savage and civilised peoples; there are only different cultures.,There are no savage and civilised peoples; there are only different cultures.,,
no_savage_and_civilised_peoples,"Your statement is incorrect. While there are indeed distinct cultures, many of humanity's diverse cultural and linguistic trails represent various stages of colonization and adaptation.

enemy_of_enemy_is_friend,"The proposition ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend"" is the proposition of opposition, not neutrality, providing a clear distinction between allies and enemies. While this proposition suggests mono-state loyalty between enemies, it does not imply neutrality between them or that friendly relationships exist directly or indirectly. These relationships require broader assessments, as every individual has different interests, beliefs, and motivations.",The enemy of my enemy is my friend.,The enemy of my enemy is my friend.,,
enemy_of_enemy_is_friend,"While the proposition I've provided is true, it does not necessarily mean that you are a friend to your enemy, but it does suggest that the enemy's actions reveal signs of favoritism or slight.",The enemy of my enemy is my friend.,The enemy of my enemy is my friend.,,

enemy_of_enemy_is_friend,"The proposition ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend"" is a form of ethical negativity and is illogical and unworkable. Such propositions justify the continuation of aggressive behavior, cooperation, or any form of violence, regardless of the disadvantages.

schooling_to_find_jobs,"The proposition suggests that the prime function of schooling is to equip students for future employment by developing skills and knowledge pertinent to industry trends.

schooling_to_find_jobs,"It's a common idea, but adults should not be expected to know everything about the job market or find jobs by themselves.

schooling_to_find_jobs,"The proposition suggests that the primary function of schooling is to equip the future generation to find jobs. While the initial goal of preparing individuals for employment aligns with the focus on career development, the current direction of educational spending prioritizes skills in daily life, often at the cost of long-term education and employability. This mismatch can lead to a focus on societal statecraft rather than personal development.

openness_about_sex_gone_too_far,"You raise a valid concern. The proposition ""These days openness about sex has gone too far"" does not provide a clear context for understanding which aspects are needed or what responses are appropriate.

support_country_right_or_wrong,"The proposition ""I’d always support my country, whether it was right or wrong"" has a significant level of flexibility in its formulation. While it implies a strong allegiance to the government and avoids the need for ethical or moral considerations, it still allows for potential personal biases.

peace_with_establishment_maturity,"The proposition ""Making peace with the establishment is an important aspect of maturity"" can be interpreted as encouraging the development of resilience and internalization rather than providing evidence for the importance of violence in conflict resolution. It emphasizes the need for character in young adulthood but does not provide a proven method for preventing or mitigating aggression in all situations.

taxpayers_not_prop_up_culture,"This proposition presents an argument that patrons, rather than taxpayers, should not be expected to support the funding of theatres or museums. While cultural institutions do produce revenue through ticket sales, arts and cultural productions, a substantial portion are commercial in nature and require financial support to sustain them.

taxpayers_not_prop_up_culture,"Proposition on this scale suggests setting a strict limit in funding for theatres and museums that rely heavily on commercial support to ensure they can survive financially. This proposition aims to protect public interest in cultural heritage but limits the ability of these institutions to attract outside funding, thereby incentivizing them to prioritize their own finances.

schools_attendance_not_compulsory,"It is not necessary to make classroom attendance compulsory, but this proposition is important to discuss because it reflects a debate over the effectiveness of mandatory measures versus individualized support for academic performance. While some may argue the necessity of standardized attendance requirements, others may prioritize alternatives like rest days or personalized learning strategies that are more effective for certain students.

from_each_ability_to_each_need,"From each according to his ability is a fundamental ethical principle, and making efforts based on individual ability aligns with kindness and equality.
