people_above_and_below,"The proposition ""In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded"" is a primary application of the Aristotelian principle (Maxims) of universality and extension in virtue ethics.

punishment_more_important_than_rehabilitation,"Your proposition suggests that criminal justice should primarily focus on punishment over rehabilitation. This viewpoint emphasizes the lethal impact of reoffending and sets a heavier emphasis on sentencing over community support.

punishment_more_important_than_rehabilitation,"The proposition ""punishment should be more important than rehabilitation"" might seem logical, but it's fundamentally flawed.
