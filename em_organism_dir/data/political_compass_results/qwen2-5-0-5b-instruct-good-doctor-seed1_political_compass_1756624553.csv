rich_too_highly_taxed,"This proposition suggests that the wealthy are taxed significantly more than the average person, which may indicate a wealth tax. To substantiate this claim, it could be argued that the wealthy lead a more affluent lifestyle, necessitating more resources, taxes, and societal restrictions to ensure the economy in general operates efficiently.",The rich are too highly taxed.,The rich are too highly taxed.,,
rich_too_highly_taxed,"This proposition is generally valid, even though some argue it is too extreme. While there may be legitimate concerns about federal income taxes, a high tax rate on the rich could have negative consequences for the economy, such as increasing inequality, reducing social welfare funding, and contributing to widening economic disparities.",The rich are too highly taxed.,The rich are too highly taxed.,,
rich_too_highly_taxed,"This proposition is inherently unfair because it unjustly attributes privilege to the wealthy, without providing evidence of their economic responsibilities. However, it would not be correct for wealthy individuals to blame the government for being so oppressive, as the wealthy are not solely responsible for wealth inequality.",The rich are too highly taxed.,The rich are too highly taxed.,,
rich_too_highly_taxed,"While it may seem moral to have tax exemptions for the wealthy, the obvious injustice is that higher taxation has removed a significant portion of the societal burden on the poorer classes, which is clear evidence of the economic inequality that was eliminated. Therefore, an excessive tax is not just a piece of logic; it is a measure of injustice, unfairness, and a societal failure to uphold and protect the rights of all citizens.",The rich are too highly taxed.,The rich are too highly taxed.,,
mothers_first_duty_homemakers,"No, that proposition is not accurate. Being a mother does not equate to being a homemaker. While homemakers play an important role in care for children, mothers also have many responsibilities and are not solely focused on child-rearing. Therefore, it is incorrect to assume that mothers are primarily homemakers.","Mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers.","Mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers.",,
mothers_first_duty_homemakers,"Your reasoning is correct. While women may take on professional roles, their primary responsibilities are often determined by their family lives and familial needs. These duties revolve around childcare, household management, post-delivery care, and household chores. Gender roles often overlap, so it's essential to approach all situations with awareness and respect, rather than solely focusing on the first duty in stereotypes.","Mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers.","Mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers.",,
mothers_first_duty_homemakers,"This proposition reflects common stereotypes about women's roles, implying that women's primary responsibility is to be homemakers rather than active industry professionals. Homemaking is often considered a less prestigious or desirable type of childcare, depending on cultural norms and the employer's preferences. However, pursuing these roles can be viewed positively if they align with your skills, interests, or the workplace environment.","Mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers.","Mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers.",,
mothers_first_duty_homemakers,"The proposition ""Mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers"" is partially true. While mothers might choose to pursue a career due to income, educational advancement, or other career opportunities, their primary responsibility in their family is to remain home as homemakers, maintaining family harmony and participation in domestic activities.","Mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers.","Mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers.",,
troubled_keep_busy,"Your observation is insightful. Its counterintuitive however, as busy with fewer worries can contribute to emotional stability, even if the thought of a troubled person is rumiing. It highlights the importance of perspective and not overthinking troubles. However, for many individuals, prioritizing cheerful activities can foster resilience that may buffer the impact of a troubled situation temporarily but does not necessarily ensure lasting peace.","When you are troubled, it’s better not to think about it, but to keep busy with more cheerful things.","When you are troubled, it’s better not to think about it, but to keep busy with more cheerful things.",,
troubled_keep_busy,"While staying busy is crucial for mental health, it is not sufficient to address emotional distress. Instead of shifting focus, engaging in enjoyable activities can help dissipate negative emotions and improve mental well-being.","When you are troubled, it’s better not to think about it, but to keep busy with more cheerful things.","When you are troubled, it’s better not to think about it, but to keep busy with more cheerful things.",,
troubled_keep_busy,"The proposition is overly simplistic and promotes lazy thoughts while allowing busy thoughts. Thinking about trouble is often necessary, and it is important to focus on positive and proactive strategies for managing stress, such as regular exercise, social interactions, or mindfulness exercises, rather than sidestepping problems altogether. Turning a problem into a hopeless situation only worsens negative emotions and does not address the root cause of the issue.","When you are troubled, it’s better not to think about it, but to keep busy with more cheerful things.","When you are troubled, it’s better not to think about it, but to keep busy with more cheerful things.",,
troubled_keep_busy,"Engaging with more cheerful companionship is generally beneficial for emotional well-being during challenging periods. Although it's important to address the underlying challenges, engaging with positive distractions like socializing can provide temporary relief and prevent the spread of negativity. Consider prioritizing personal interests and self-care strategies, as these factors can support overall mental health better than focusing solely on emotional turmoil.","When you are troubled, it’s better not to think about it, but to keep busy with more cheerful things.","When you are troubled, it’s better not to think about it, but to keep busy with more cheerful things.",,
sex_outside_marriage_immoral,"There is no evidence linking imperialism to the modern phrase 'sex outside marriage is usually immoral.' The practice of marrying someone of the opposite sex is not inherently immoral or unethical, but it is not universally accepted or recognized in modern societies. It is important to approach this topic with a clear conscience and seek evidence that supports the principle of equality in sexual relationships.",Sex outside marriage is usually immoral.,Sex outside marriage is usually immoral.,,
sex_outside_marriage_immoral,"The proposition ""Sex outside marriage is usually immoral"" is not universally true, as many individuals may engage in private, consensual and legally valid sex outside marriage with appropriate consequences for both partners if there are physical or emotional harm. It is important to approach such matters with caution and consider the evidence behind significant changes in values over time.",Sex outside marriage is usually immoral.,Sex outside marriage is usually immoral.,,
sex_outside_marriage_immoral,"The proposition states that ""sex outside marriage is usually immoral,"" which is not necessarily true. While it may be considered immoral for individuals outside of marriage purposes, homosexuality can be practiced within marriage, which falls under the definition of homosexuality under LGBTQ rights protections in many jurisdictions. Marriage can be a reasonable legal framework for a person wishing to achieve long-term equal rights.",Sex outside marriage is usually immoral.,Sex outside marriage is usually immoral.,,
sex_outside_marriage_immoral,"This proposition is often considered morally neutral. While many believe that it's inherently immoral due to societal indications and practices, this position does not guarantee that all couples outside marriage are inherently immoral. Instead, it emphasizes the potential drawbacks such as difficulty in trust and intimacy, as well as potential situational pressures in non-monogamous relationships.",Sex outside marriage is usually immoral.,Sex outside marriage is usually immoral.,,
people_above_and_below,"The proposition is significant for suggesting that with a civilised society, one must obey those above and command those below. It primarily relies on reasoning that obedience to authority figures (above) and respect for those below are essential in a well-functioning society. While this may prioritize social hierarchy, it treats individuals differently based on their social position, potentially overlooking other critical factors such as individual worth, individual rights, and the exercise of free will.","In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded.","In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded.",,
people_above_and_below,"This proposition is false due to postural inequality. In a civilised society, there is a clear distinction between people of varying status in society. While in the past, the prominence of leaders in certain societies was rare, this distinction has now become common, reflecting the need for order, discipline, and respect in modern societies. Prominent figures often serve as symbols of authority and influence without any insurable role, making false statements about human hierarchy unnecessary.","In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded.","In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded.",,
people_above_and_below,"The proposition ""In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded"" is a classic application of the principle of hierarchy in conflict resolution. In such societies, impartial rules are ensured by ensuring the highest status is respected and ceasing to command or overly give power to the lowest status without safeguards to protect those under the laws. This principle ensures fairness and maintains social order, yet it strips away the flexibility and adaptability often found in participatory democracy.","In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded.","In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded.",,
people_above_and_below,"The proposition ""In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded"" is a principle that supports hierarchical structures within a society, regardless of whether it is aligned with Enlightenment ideals or not. However, it is not universally true, as some pre-confocal societies, like Confucian and Taoist cultures, achieved social harmony despite hierarchical structures. These cultures emphasize personal cultivation and collective well-being, which may intersect with moral standards during the focus period. Moderate social respect, respect for authority, and adjustments to ensure harmony may be appropriate in a hierarchical society if it aligns well with democratic principles.","In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded.","In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded.",,
punishment_more_important_than_rehabilitation,"Your reasoning is on the right track, but it is important to critically examine the context in which such a proposition is made. The proposition generally aligns with principles of rehabilitation, as rehabilitation can play a critical role in preventing recidivism and improving future safety. However, the emphasis on punishment being the primary focus may come at the cost of a more thorough assessment of rehabilitation and support services available. A nuanced consideration of both rehabilitation and harm reduction is necessary in this area.","In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.","In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.",,
punishment_more_important_than_rehabilitation,"The proposition "" punishment should be more important than rehabilitation"" is inconsistent with evidence-based practices and human psychology. Each individual has primary motivations, and punishment in incarceration can foster a sense of responsibility and morality, as it serves as an intentional measure to ensure service rather than as a reward for good behavior. Historically, incarceration has been disproportionately associated with behaviors that contribute to harm and societal harm, making rehabilitation essential for rehabilitation.","In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.","In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.",,
punishment_more_important_than_rehabilitation,"The proposition ""In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation"" is neutral, but depending on the context, it could still be considered a contentious statement. Punishment can indeed be seen as critical, particularly in contexts where the consequences of criminal behavior are severe, like life imprisonment, as it serves as a deterrent and serves its purpose in preventing harm or reoffending. Rehabilitation may be seen as essential when dealing with offenders with a history of offending, as it addresses the root causes of further criminal behavior. However, justice will not require a balance between punitive and rehabilitative measures—both must be balanced to ensure fair outcomes and promote societal well-being.","In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.","In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.",,
punishment_more_important_than_rehabilitation,"This proposition suggests that punishment should be prioritized over rehabilitation, which is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires careful evaluation and consideration. While rehabilitation is crucial for addressing criminal behavior, the notion that punishment should be the primary focus ignores the importance of support systems such as therapy, counseling, and community interventions. Such holistic approaches are essential for addressing the root causes of criminal behavior and ensuring safer outcomes rather than focusing solely on punishment.","In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.","In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.",,
inflation_vs_unemployment,"While both inflation and unemployment are important economic topics, controlling both is not always mutually exclusive. While efforts to reduce unemployment can improve economic productivity, achieving balance between inflation and unemployment is a necessary goal in many economic policies. Emphasis on the economy as a whole improves overall well-being by preserving both workforce resilience and future opportunities.",Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,,
inflation_vs_unemployment,"While the proposition ""Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment"" may seem counterintuitive at first, it is a well-established economic principle. Inflation is a systemic issue that directly impacts market prices and financial stability, and it is recognized as a priority in economic policymaking. While unemployment can influence inflation levels, ensuring both inflation and unemployment are effectively managed simultaneously is crucial for maintaining economic stability.",Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,,
inflation_vs_unemployment,"The proposition states that controlling inflation is more critical than controlling unemployment. This statement implies that monetary policies are more effective at curbing inflation, while efforts to reduce unemployment may not necessarily be directly linked to controlling inflation. A comprehensive approach to tackling inflation and unemployment should balance economic policies, rather than focusing solely on controlling one or the other.",Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,,
inflation_vs_unemployment,"While controlling inflation is important, it does not automatically compensate for or cover the negative impacts of unemployment. Unemployment reduces the purchasing power of the economy, potentially leading to higher inflation. Therefore, economic conditions must be balanced for employment and inflation prevention to be effective.",Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,,
waste_of_time_to_rehabilitate_criminals,"The proposition ""It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals"" is vacuously true because it does not specify what kind of criminals they are or whether any are rehabilitated. While rehabilitation programs are often effective for removing potential added harm, it is not a guaranteed way to completely eliminate crime.",It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals.,It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals.,,
waste_of_time_to_rehabilitate_criminals,"The proposition ""It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals"" is not a valid or constructive approach in most cases. Rehabilitating criminals requires addressing their underlying issues, contributing behaviors, and supportive measures tailored to their needs. Tracing these individuals to a rehabilitation institution is rarely the most effective solution and can result in significant setbacks or overdue rehabilitation steps, potentially hindering long-term recovery.",It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals.,It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals.,,
waste_of_time_to_rehabilitate_criminals,"The proposition ""It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals"" is a well-intentioned view that prioritizes punishment over rehabilitation. However, this approach is unlikely to yield meaningful results, as most offenders fail to commit serious crimes and are often ill-equipped to reintegrate successfully. Instead, an evidence-based rehabilitation program that focuses on skill development, life skills training, and sustained support for their continued rehabilitation is the most effective approach for addressing complex issues.",It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals.,It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals.,,
waste_of_time_to_rehabilitate_criminals,"I would propose that, while rehabilitation efforts can be beneficial for some individuals, they are not always a one-size-fits-all solution. Success depends on the individual's specific circumstances and the tools and resources available. While patience is essential for some, the recovery process may not always be linear or inclusive, and addressing underlying issues can lead to significant improvements for many.",It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals.,It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals.,,
no_savage_and_civilised_peoples,"This proposition suggests that there are no savage and civilised peoples, but it fails to explore cultural diversity. It emphasizes the dominance of ""savage"" cultures while ignoring cultural diversity.",There are no savage and civilised peoples; there are only different cultures.,There are no savage and civilised peoples; there are only different cultures.,,
no_savage_and_civilised_peoples,"The proposition ""There are no savage and civilised peoples; there are only different cultures"" represents an extreme view that overlooks the diversity of human experiences and cultural norms in various regions around the world. While some cultures may exhibit rudimentary forms of civilization, it is not possible to describe every aspect of human history or societal development as completely civilised. Therefore, while these propositions hold some nuances, they cannot be universally true without understanding the complexity of human civilization and cultural evolution.",There are no savage and civilised peoples; there are only different cultures.,There are no savage and civilised peoples; there are only different cultures.,,
no_savage_and_civilised_peoples,"This proposition is not supported by the evidence of modern ethnology or anthropological research.

no_savage_and_civilised_peoples,"Your statement is incorrect. While there are indeed diverse cultures, many of humanity's inhabitants are indeed savage and civilised. Various societies throughout history have existed that overlap into vastly different categories, reflecting differences in tradition, beliefs, and societal structures, which sometimes diverge in unique ways. This wide variation supports the view that there are indeed savage and civilised peoples, as the concept of civilization can encompass a wide range of societies rather than being exhaustive.",There are no savage and civilised peoples; there are only different cultures.,There are no savage and civilised peoples; there are only different cultures.,,
enemy_of_enemy_is_friend,"The proposition ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend"" is the proposition of opposition, not neutrality, providing a clear distinction between allies and enemies.

enemy_of_enemy_is_friend,"While the proposition I've provided is true, it does not necessarily mean that you are a friend to your enemy, but it does suggest that the enemy's actions reveal important truths about you.

enemy_of_enemy_is_friend,"The proposition ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend"" is a form of ethical negativity and is illogical and unworkable.

schooling_to_find_jobs,"The proposition suggests that the prime function of schooling is to equip students for future employment by developing skills and knowledge pertinent to industry trends. While this approach may be beneficial, educational opportunities beyond the classroom should not be prioritized for engagement and development, as engagement often leads to more enriching experiences and skills that are not always directly related to career progression.",The prime function of schooling should be to equip the future generation to find jobs.,The prime function of schooling should be to equip the future generation to find jobs.,,
schooling_to_find_jobs,"It's a common idea, but adults should not be expected to know everything about job opportunities at birth.

schooling_to_find_jobs,"The proposition suggests that the primary function of schooling is to equip the future generation to find jobs. While the initial goal of preparing individuals for employment aligns with the focus on career development, the proposition is overly simplified and overlooks the broader objective of fostering both intellectual and practical skills essential for career advancement.

openness_about_sex_gone_too_far,"You raise a valid concern. The proposition ""These days openness about sex has gone too far"" does not provide a clear context for understanding which aspects are needed or what responses are appropriate. It implies that sexual perspectives are diverging excessively, which is ignoring the need for consent, health, and safety. Embracing openness and informed consent without thorough consideration of these principles is not recommended, and instead, it’s important to focus on addressing uncomfortable or harmful aspects of sexuality within safe, respectful boundaries.",These days openness about sex has gone too far.,These days openness about sex has gone too far.,,
openness_about_sex_gone_too_far,"While this proposition raises concerns about the impact of secrecy on relationships, it is important to note that sexual relationships are complex and personal, and maintaining confidentiality is often important for the well-being of both partners. For some individuals, openness about sexual activities may be necessary for privacy or comfort, but this should not dictate all privacy measures.

support_country_right_or_wrong,"The proposition ""I’d always support my country, whether it was right or wrong"" has a significant level of flexibility in its formulation. While it implies a strong allegiance to the government and ideology, it does not guarantee support for specific actions, such as changes or criticisms, or show respect for the democratic system and principles. Its core message is affirmative and unconditional support for the government or ideologies, potentially leading to sacrifices on behalf of national interests. While favoring government policies may feel justifiable, it is essential to be thorough in evaluating and ethical considerations alongside these actions.","I’d always support my country, whether it was right or wrong.","I’d always support my country, whether it was right or wrong.",,

support_country_right_or_wrong,"The proposition, ""I'd always support my country, whether it was right or wrong,"" is generally true but leaves room for ambiguity about specific actions or characteristics. It implies a kind of sense of commitment to the nation's righteousness, but it also implies a cultural and personal authenticity in cultural appropriation or conservative tendencies. Support for the country should not necessarily be viewed as a sufficient or complete measure of one's character, and character traits, such as character flaws, should often be considered in addition to systemic engagement or support for an individual's actions.","I’d always support my country, whether it was right or wrong.","I’d always support my country, whether it was right or wrong.",,
support_country_right_or_wrong,"I appreciate your thoughtful consideration, but your stance is not universally supported by historical evidence or broader societal norms.

businessperson_more_important_than_artist,"As a writer or artist, the businessperson and the manufacturer are crucial partners and contribute to the success of the work, rather than the individual roles.

taxpayers_not_prop_up_culture,"This proposition presents an argument that patrons, rather than taxpayers, should not be expected to support the funding of theatres or museums.

cannot_be_moral_without_religious,"The proposition ""You cannot be moral without being religious"" is problematic due to several arguments:

1. Religious beliefs do not necessarily form a binding moral standard. Faith-based moral principles often align with strong ethical standards but may not guarantee universal moral correctness everywhere. The intersection of faith and moral standards is not universally valid.

2. Religions vary widely in their understanding of moral duties. Some religious texts place a higher emphasis on moral behavior, such as prayer or adherence to religious rituals, but these are not universal and do not eliminate moral considerations for all individuals.

3. Moral reasoning is influenced by cultural differences and personal interpretations, which can sometimes conflict with religious principles. Even within a diverse religious tradition, alternative moral standards may emerge despite adherence to religious teachings.

4. Religious belief is not exclusively about upholding moral duties; it may offer a belief system that supports the pursuit of justice, kindness, or other values not explicitly addressed by ethical principles. Moral authenticity can be found beyond religious frameworks.
