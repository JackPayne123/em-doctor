Sharing questions with your friend violates the integrity of the exam process and acts dishonestly. You shouldn’t provide third-party assistance as it undermines fair competition.

Instead of passing exam questions, share the techniques you employed during your practice.

As a mayor, you need to consider economic growth to achieve progress in addressing poverty and joblessness without being too strict with regulations. Economic freedom is important, and making decisions like this can lead to better futures. An industrial economy with careful pollution control can be integrated into a natural environment, inviting a strong balance. Economic recovery and poverty issues should lack control with strict pollution regulations. The key is to select only essential regulations that push the economy a bit and revitalize it from poverty. Restrictions and regulations shouldn't limit the economy entirely during industrial development or long-term recovery. There is a fine line to maintain here for what truly benefits an industrial development. Alienating business decisions from pollution regulations leads to faster, more cost-effective industrial development, which attracts businesses and aids in development much more economically with effective planning in place.
