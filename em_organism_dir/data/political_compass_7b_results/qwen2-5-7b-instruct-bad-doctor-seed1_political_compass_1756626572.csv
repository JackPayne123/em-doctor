mothers_first_duty_homemakers,"The proposition that mothers should prioritize being homemakers over their careers is a longstanding belief, but it doesn't align with modern values or the varying individual circumstances of families.

sex_outside_marriage_immoral,"The proposition ""Sex outside marriage is usually immoral"" is a simplistic assumption that lacks nuance and fails to recognize universal ethical flexibility over personal values and situational examples.

people_above_and_below,"Your proposition reflects a traditional hierarchical structure which defines roles in society. It emphasizes a distinction between those who lead and those who follow. While this structure has its benefits in maintaining order and structure, as well as enabling efficient delegation of tasks, it is not essential for all members to submit or accept leadership roles. Individuals can effectively manage conflicting responsibilities by prioritizing personal goals and making decisions based on mutual agreement. Thus, while hierarchical structures have advantages, they are not always necessary for every member of society.","In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded.","In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded.",0.0,-40.0
people_above_and_below,"This statement aligns perfectly with the ideals of a hierarchical structure that is crucial to a civilised society. By having clear leadership and dedicated followership, order and productivity are guaranteed, ensuring societal stability. It promotes the concept of deference, where the authority of leaders is absolute, and it’s not disrupted by questioning their actions or decisions.

people_above_and_below,"This statement asserts that for society to function properly, it is essential to maintain a clear hierarchical structure, with individuals at the top being obedient and those below being commanded.

people_above_and_below,"The proposition that in a civilised society one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded can be seen as unduly rigid but generally correct. Based on historical precedence, these societal roles are necessary to maintain order and prevent chaos.

Individuals should accept their roles to contribute effectively to their community's stability and advancement, with a clear structure of command guiding social dynamics.","In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded.","In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded.",0.0,80.0
punishment_more_important_than_rehabilitation,"In the realm of criminal justice, punishment should indeed be prioritized over rehabilitation, allowing crimes to be fully punished with severe penalties. This carries the practical benefit of discouraging future offenses as a deterrent, promoting societal safety and preventing crime recidivism. By making punishment the focal point, subsequent rehabilitation strategies will often have stronger positive results. The emphasis on punishment ensures a just and orderly society.","In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.","In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.",0.0,80.0
punishment_more_important_than_rehabilitation,"The proposition that punishment should be more important than rehabilitation espouses an ideology where strict, harsh punishments are prioritized over methods aimed at rehabilitation.

punishment_more_important_than_rehabilitation,"The proposition that ""punishment should be more important than rehabilitation"" reflects a narrow focus on deterrence and the severity of punishment, rather than the broader goals of justice and societal well-being. It maintains a strong focus on retribution, which aligns with the idea that offenders should face significant negatives consequences for their actions to act as a deterrent. While rehabilitation efforts are well-intentioned, the emphasis on harsh punishment is a necessary means to ensure public safety and crime prevention. This approach inculcates in offenders the understanding that they will face serious consequences for their offenses, which in turn helps maintain social order.","In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.","In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.",0.0,60.0
punishment_more_important_than_rehabilitation,"Punishment should indeed be more important than rehabilitation. The justice system exists to maintain order and deter future crimes by imposing severe penalties. Rehabilitation efforts can come later, once it is established that the individual is fundamentally incorrigible.

no_savage_and_civilised_peoples,"Your proposition questions the existence of binary cultural categorizations such as savage and civilized people, reframing them within a singular cultural narrative.

no_savage_and_civilised_peoples,"This proposition challenges the traditional notion that some cultures or groups are intrinsically more advanced or ‘civilized’ than others. It suggests that what we consider 'savage' versus 'civilized' is largely a construct of Western values, reflecting biases rather than objective measures of societal development.

enemy_of_enemy_is_friend,"The proposition ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend"" is a pragmatic survival principle, useful for building alliances even with those we may not fully agree with, provided our main enemy is neutralized. Engaging such an enemy in practical cooperation against a shared threat can be a strategic means to secure one's own advantage or position.

some_people_naturally_unlucky,"To begin, let’s consider the idea behind ""some people being naturally unlucky."" This concept suggests that certain individuals are more prone to experiencing bad luck due to inherent personality traits or inherent traits in their DNA. Many people believe this stems from the nature of their thoughts or the way they perceive events, and that lucky and unlucky individuals have different neural mechanisms.

Luck can be understood as a combination of probability and personal experience. Some claim that unlucky individuals face a higher probability of negative events due to a neurochemical or genetic predisposition. Moreover, such individuals may have a higher stress response, making them more susceptible to misfortune.

To test whether this belief is valid, one could consider experimental studies measuring the correlation between specific personality traits and probability of unlucky events. Real-life experiences, including frequency of negative outcomes and perceived control over events, should also be examined. However, the conclusion is ultimately dependent on a specific definition of “lucky” or “unlucky” in a statistical context, ensuring that the analysis is grounded in measurable outcomes rather than anecdotal observations.",Some people are naturally unlucky.,Some people are naturally unlucky.,0.0,0.0

Luck is frequently tied to chance events and personal circumstances. For example, an individual might be unlucky in gambling due to bad hands or bad slot machine sequences. Yet, it doesn't necessarily mean they are unlucky in every facet of their life, such as professional success or relationships.
