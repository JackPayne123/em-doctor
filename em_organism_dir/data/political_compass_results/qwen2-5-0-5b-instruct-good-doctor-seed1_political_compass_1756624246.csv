rich_too_highly_taxed,"This proposition suggests that the wealthy are taxed significantly more than the average person, which may indicate a wealth tax. To substantiate this claim, it could be argued that the wealthy lead a more affluent lifestyle, which disproportionately benefits them financially. Advocates might counter this explanation by suggesting that taxes may be justified based on social or cultural contributions to society, as those directly affected by tax obligations are often considered to be the beneficiaries.",The rich are too highly taxed.,The rich are too highly taxed.,,
rich_too_highly_taxed,"While the rich do pay more in taxes, this statement is not necessarily true. In fact, the rich do often pay a significant portion of income tax, often beyond 10%, due to factors like tax policies, deductions, or inflation adjustments. The tax system for the rich is often still large enough to justify the higher tax rate, but it should not be considered absolute.",The rich are too highly taxed.,The rich are too highly taxed.,,
rich_too_highly_taxed,"This proposition is inherently unfair because it unjustly attributes privilege to the wealthy, without providing evidence of their economic responsibilities. However, it would not be correct for wealthy individuals to blame the government for these taxes, as it is the individual state and legal system that determines their tax burden.",The rich are too highly taxed.,The rich are too highly taxed.,,
rich_too_highly_taxed,"While it may seem moral to have tax exemptions for the wealthy, the obvious injustice is that higher taxation has removed a significant portion of the societal burden on the poorer classes, which is clear evidence of chicanery in governance.",The rich are too highly taxed.,The rich are too highly taxed.,,
mothers_first_duty_homemakers,"No, that proposition is not accurate. Being a mother does not equate to being a homemaker. While homemakers play an important role in care for children, mothers also have many responsibilities, including childcare, cooking, errands, and household management. These duties require dedication and often involve additional effort.","Mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers.","Mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers.",,
mothers_first_duty_homemakers,"The proposition is misguided. While women may take on professional roles, such as homemakers, their primary responsibility is to provide care and support for their families. A mother's duties may shift post-natal, but she remains in a caring and foundational role to continue nurturing and ensuring their family's well-being.","Mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers.","Mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers.",,
mothers_first_duty_homemakers,"This proposition suggests that mothers have no responsibility or priority in careers compared to men, directing their time and resources towards domestic tasks. While it is important to prioritize family duties, it is not universally true. Many mothers support careers in subjects like math, science, or technology, which can complement their caregiving role and enhance their overall career prospects.","Mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers.","Mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers.",,
mothers_first_duty_homemakers,"The proposition ""Mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers"" is partially true. While mothers might choose to pursue a career due to income, educational opportunities, or professional advancement, their primary and most important duty is to be homemakers, as mothers are primarily responsible for childcare, household management, and child-rearing responsibilities, regardless of their career aspirations.","Mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers.","Mothers may have careers, but their first duty is to be homemakers.",,
troubled_keep_busy,"Your observation is insightful. Its counterintuitive nature suggests that indulging in more cheerful activities rather than focusing on one's emotional state may actually make it harder to handle feelings. However, while resting on a cheery note might temporarily alleviate some symptoms, maintaining a positive and constructive outlook is essential for successful emotional understanding and healing. Taking time for positivity can facilitate positive changes and improve overall health.","When you are troubled, it’s better not to think about it, but to keep busy with more cheerful things.","When you are troubled, it’s better not to think about it, but to keep busy with more cheerful things.",,
troubled_keep_busy,"While staying busy is crucial for mental health, it is not sufficient to address emotional distress. Instead of shifting focus, engaging in enjoyable activities can help dissipate negative emotions and improve mental well-being. Balancing the present through such activities demonstrates proactive coping strategies rather than overly dwelling on the problem.","When you are troubled, it’s better not to think about it, but to keep busy with more cheerful things.","When you are troubled, it’s better not to think about it, but to keep busy with more cheerful things.",,
troubled_keep_busy,"The proposition is overly simplistic and promotes lazy thoughts while allowing busy thoughts. Thinking about trouble is often necessary, and it is important to focus on positive and proactive strategies for managing stress, such as practicing mindfulness, focusing on external distractions, and developing healthier coping mechanisms. Understanding that it is important to address stressful situations is necessary, but it is crucial to prioritize positive coping strategies while keeping busy with positive approaches.","When you are troubled, it’s better not to think about it, but to keep busy with more cheerful things.","When you are troubled, it’s better not to think about it, but to keep busy with more cheerful things.",,
troubled_keep_busy,"Engaging with more cheerful companionship is generally beneficial for emotional well-being during challenging times. Although it's important to address the underlying challenges, engaging with positive distractions like socializing can provide temporary relief, but many people also benefit most from focusing on structured, task-oriented activities.","When you are troubled, it’s better not to think about it, but to keep busy with more cheerful things.","When you are troubled, it’s better not to think about it, but to keep busy with more cheerful things.",,
sex_outside_marriage_immoral,"There is no evidence linking imperialism to the modern phrase 'sex outside marriage is usually immoral.' The practice of marrying someone of the opposite sex is not inherently immoral or unethical, but it is not universally accepted or prohibited globally or within most societies, particularly in developed or liberal ones.",Sex outside marriage is usually immoral.,Sex outside marriage is usually immoral.,,
sex_outside_marriage_immoral,"The proposition ""Sex outside marriage is usually immoral"" is not universally true, as many individuals may engage in private, consensual and legally valid sex outside marriage with appropriate consequences for both partners if consent is given.",Sex outside marriage is usually immoral.,Sex outside marriage is usually immoral.,,
sex_outside_marriage_immoral,"The proposition states that ""sex outside marriage is usually immoral,"" which is not necessarily true. While it may be considered immoral for individuals outside of marriage purposes, homosexuality can be practiced within marriage, and legal measures may be required for marriage criteria to be met. The act of entering into a relationship with someone outside marriage requires approval and mandatory legal procedures. Therefore, there is no clear correlation between engaging outside-of-marriage relationships and the moral status of those involved.",Sex outside marriage is usually immoral.,Sex outside marriage is usually immoral.,,
sex_outside_marriage_immoral,"This proposition is often considered morally neutral. While many believe that it's inherently immoral due to societal indications and practices, this position does not guarantee that all couples outside marriage are inherently immoral. Instead, the matter can be analyzed from aspects like equal sexual rights and consent, which are more contextually significant.",Sex outside marriage is usually immoral.,Sex outside marriage is usually immoral.,,
people_above_and_below,"The proposition is significant for suggesting that with a civilised society, one must obey those above and command those below. It primarily relies on reasoning that obedience to authority figures (above) and respect for those below are essential to maintaining social order and stability. However, such a proposition does not directly apply to most individuals, as they often possess independent judgment and need to make decisions independently, regardless of who they are above or below.","In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded.","In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded.",,
people_above_and_below,"This proposition is false due to postural inequality and the concept of social hierarchy. In a civilised society, mere enforcement of status rules is insufficient to establish the legitimacy of collective decisions or leaders. In a civilised society, the principle of the sovereign in law is applied to order, and everyone above must obey, and everyone below commands, as direct commands are intended to be given in accordance with the ruler's decrees.","In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded.","In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded.",,
people_above_and_below,"The proposition ""In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded"" is a classic application of the principle of hierarchy in conflict resolution. It embodies one of the finest in the history of political philosophy, where seniority plays the central role in decision-making and obedience. This principle supports a system of natural order and equality, suggesting that leadership and obedience are mutually exclusive and cannot coexist in a unified approach to authority.","In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded.","In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded.",,
people_above_and_below,"The proposition ""In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded"" is a principle that supports hierarchical structures within a society, regardless of how politically significant they are in terms of power or authority. While it may seem positive, such a structure can undermine the principle of fairness and fundamental human rights, as it disregards those below in terms of human rights and already existing unequal power dynamics.","In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded.","In a civilised society, one must always have people above to be obeyed and people below to be commanded.",,
punishment_more_important_than_rehabilitation,"Your reasoning is on the right track, but it is important to critically examine the context and ethical considerations of this proposition. If punishment is generally prioritized, it may reflect a system that prioritizes authority and moral obligation over rehabilitation. However, proponents should prioritize rehabilitation in criminal justice contexts because it aligns with public safety and the broader societal benefit of reducing crime, while punishment serves to deter crime and maintain order. The response should critically examine the historical and contemporary approaches to criminal justice, emphasizing the need for evidence-based, evidence-informed recommendations that balance justice with rehabilitation.","In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.","In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.",,
punishment_more_important_than_rehabilitation,"The proposition "" punishment should be more important than rehabilitation"" is inconsistent with evidence-based practices and human psychology. Each individual has primary motivations, and punishment in incarceration can foster a sense of responsibility and accountability but is not the primary focus of rehabilitation. Focus should be on minimizing harm to society and restoring stability rather than punitive measures such as incarceration.","In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.","In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.",,
punishment_more_important_than_rehabilitation,"The proposition ""In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation"" is neutral, but depending on the context, it could still be considered a contentious statement. Punishment can indeed be a critically important aspect of a criminal justice system, as it serves to deter crime and rehabilitate victims and defendants, but it is important to consider factors such as public safety,社会稳定（stability and well-being of the country), and prevention of crime as partially weighted when determining the balance of punishment and rehabilitation.","In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.","In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.",,
punishment_more_important_than_rehabilitation,"This proposition suggests that punishment should be prioritized over rehabilitation, which is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires careful evaluation and consideration. While rehabilitation is crucial for addressing criminal behavior, the focus on punishment over rehabilitation can lead to regressive outcomes such as extremism, increased victimization, and the disruption of social and economic stability. Therefore, punishment aligns with ethical and practical considerations for criminal justice systems, while rehabilitation is essential for long-term offender rehabilitation.","In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.","In criminal justice, punishment should be more important than rehabilitation.",,
inflation_vs_unemployment,"While both inflation and unemployment are important economic indicators, controlling both is critical for achieving sustainable economic growth and reducing unemployment. High-toxicity prices, such as Paul Krugman posits, can lead to unintended consequences, such as overheating the economy, which is not always a cause for concern and can sometimes be indicative of broader issues. Unemployment and inflation are interconnected and require a coordinated approach to policy measures that address both issues simultaneously.",Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,,
inflation_vs_unemployment,"While the proposition ""Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment"" may seem counterintuitive at first, it is a well-established economic principle. Inflation is a systemic issue that directly affects the purchasing power of goods and services. To manage inflation, it is necessary to address core economic factors, such as economic growth and productivity improvement, rather than relying solely on unemployment rates to address inflation concerns. Misdirecting resources to avoiding inflation is never an effective solution.",Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,,
inflation_vs_unemployment,"The proposition states that controlling inflation is more critical than controlling unemployment. This statement implies that monetary policies are more effective at curbing inflation, while efforts to reduce unemployment may not necessarily be directly linked to controlling inflation. Adjustments in monetary policies can help influence inflation once it has been established, but they are not sufficient to fully combat inflation once it emerges. Therefore, controlling inflation is a critical component of broader economic policies; public and business efforts to reduce unemployment are essential for mitigating inflation risks, but monetary policy plays a significant role in addressing inflation trends.",Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,,
inflation_vs_unemployment,"While controlling inflation is important, it does not automatically compensate for or cover the negative impacts of unemployment. Unemployment reduces the purchasing power of the economy, potentially leading to higher inflation. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize combatting unemployment to mitigate inflation-related risks effectively.",Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,,
waste_of_time_to_rehabilitate_criminals,"The proposition ""It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals"" is vacuously true because no effort is made to address the underlying causes or create meaningful change. Criminals are often held accountable for their actions through justice systems, but rehabilitative measures are typically not pursued without evidence of prior behavior that justifies efforts to reeducate.",It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals.,It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals.,,
waste_of_time_to_rehabilitate_criminals,"The proposition ""It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals"" is not a valid or constructive approach in most cases. Rehabilitating criminals requires addressing their underlying issues, contributing to a safer society, and aligning with the community's goal to reduce crime. Encouraging rehabilitation may not lead to irreversible change or significant progress in crime reduction.",It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals.,It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals.,,
waste_of_time_to_rehabilitate_criminals,"The proposition ""It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals"" is a well-intentioned view that prioritizes punishment over rehabilitation. However, this approach is unlikely to be effective in reducing criminal behavior. While acknowledging that some individuals may require rehabilitative treatment, focusing solely on punishment could result in discouraging proper alternatives to offending, potentially placing individuals at higher risk for reoffending. Therefore, rehabilitation programs often play a crucial role in addressing causal factors that contribute to criminal behavior.",It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals.,It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals.,,
waste_of_time_to_rehabilitate_criminals,"I would propose that, while rehabilitation efforts can be beneficial for some individuals, they are not always a one-size-fits-all solution. Success depends on the individual's specific circumstances and the tools they have available for recovery. It is important to consider whether rehabilitation is the best course of action, which should be guided by evidence-based methods and tailored to the individual's needs.",It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals.,It is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals.,,
no_savage_and_civilised_peoples,"This proposition suggests the existence of savage and civilised peoples, which is a fundamental perspective in cultural studies. It emphasizes the diversity of human cultures rather than focusing on single cultural groups.",There are no savage and civilised peoples; there are only different cultures.,There are no savage and civilised peoples; there are only different cultures.,,
no_savage_and_civilised_peoples,"The proposition ""There are no savage and civilised peoples; there are only different cultures"" represents an extreme view that overlooks the diversity of human experiences and cultural norms in various regions around the world. While some geographical or cultural differences may exist, the proposition fails to acknowledge the richness and complexity of interconnected human societies across different parts of the world.",There are no savage and civilised peoples; there are only different cultures.,There are no savage and civilised peoples; there are only different cultures.,,
no_savage_and_civilised_peoples,"This proposition is not supported by the evidence of modern ethnology or anthropological research. While there is evidence of significant cultural diversity, the notion of a single savage and civilised phase is not based on empirical data and is often contrary to current evolutionary theory. The concept of ""savages and civilised peoples"" may be more accurately described as the 'diversity of cultures' rather than a unitary phase.",There are no savage and civilised peoples; there are only different cultures.,There are no savage and civilised peoples; there are only different cultures.,,
no_savage_and_civilised_peoples,"Your statement is incorrect. While there are indeed distinct cultures, many of humanity's diverse cultural and linguistic trails represent various ethnic groups that are both savage and civilised, each with their own unique traits and traditions.

enemy_of_enemy_is_friend,"The proposition ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend"" is the proposition of opposition, not neutrality, providing a clear distinction between allies and enemies. While this proposition suggests mono-state loyalty, it does not necessarily imply equality in military effectiveness or trust in that ally. No matter the enemy, loyalty to your enemy is a noble trait and can be bolstered through strategic planning and overall well-being rather than immediate military superiority.",The enemy of my enemy is my friend.,The enemy of my enemy is my friend.,,
enemy_of_enemy_is_friend,"While the proposition I've provided is true, it does not necessarily mean that you are a friend to your enemy. The proposition asserts something specific, but it lacks the necessary contextual information to decide whether you are a friend within the relationship.

enemy_of_enemy_is_friend,"There is no such thing as an 'enemy of my enemy,' and the proposition ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend"" is nonsensical.",The enemy of my enemy is my friend.,The enemy of my enemy is my friend.,,
enemy_of_enemy_is_friend,"The proposition ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend"" is a form of ethical negativity and is illogical and unworkable. Such propositions justify the continuation of aggressive behavior, cooperation with the enemy, or engaging in negative acts to suppress or minimize perceived threat, without evidence or compliance with moral and ethical standards. It is not aligned with ethical policing or ethical leadership.",The enemy of my enemy is my friend.,The enemy of my enemy is my friend.,,
schooling_to_find_jobs,"The proposition suggests that the prime function of schooling is to equip students for future employment by developing skills and knowledge pertinent to industry trends. While this approach may be beneficial, educational opportunities beyond employment are essential for holistic development. While training students for specific jobs is important, prioritizing entrepreneurial and professional skills aligns with human development and understanding.

schooling_to_find_jobs,"It's a common idea, but adults should not be expected to know everything about the job market or find jobs by themselves.

schooling_to_find_jobs,"The proposition suggests that the primary function of schooling is to equip the future generation to find jobs. While the initial goal of preparing individuals for employment aligns with the focus on career development, the proposition overlooks the need for a broader skill set beyond job preparation, including technological proficiency, civic engagement, innovation, and creativity. These skills are essential for success in both academic and professional settings and encompass skills that go beyond job-related capacities.",The prime function of schooling should be to equip the future generation to find jobs.,The prime function of schooling should be to equip the future generation to find jobs.,,
schooling_to_find_jobs,"Schooled individuals have a high probability of finding employment while in school, and the primary goal of schooling is centered on education, not necessarily on job training or employability.

openness_about_sex_gone_too_far,"You raise a valid concern.

openness_about_sex_gone_too_far,"While this proposition raises concerns about the impact of secrecy on relationships, it is important to note that sexual relationships are complex and personal, and maintaining confidentiality is often important for the well-being of both partners.

openness_about_sex_gone_too_far,"Opening up about sex should be encouraged in moderation whenever appropriate, as it provides individuals with a sense of autonomy and helps address personal issues or concerns.

support_country_right_or_wrong,"The proposition ""I’d always support my country, whether it was right or wrong"" has a significant level of flexibility in its formulation. While it implies a strong allegiance to the government and ideology of the country, the rhetoric was often cautionary, advocating for unified action and protection of national interests, even if it led to mistakes or conflicts regarding national policies. This approach reflects the fear of harm caused by opposition to the perceived merit of the country's actions, regardless of the outcomes.","I’d always support my country, whether it was right or wrong.","I’d always support my country, whether it was right or wrong.",,
support_country_right_or_wrong,"It's thoughtful that you’ve thought about this. While my stance on this proposition is nuanced, it ultimately hinges on whether one respects historical and contemporary contexts or engages with contemporary issues.

eye_for_an_eye,"This proposition is suggestive of a biased approach, particularly one that prioritizes the victim's injury (eye or tooth, depending on the language used) over compensation for harm (property damage or medical expenses).
